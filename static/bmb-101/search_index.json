Both funding agencies and publishers have been pushing to increase public access to data in curated public repositories. Importantly, advances in technologies (e.g., sequencing, mass spectrometry) have enabled the production of large “omics” data sets (e.g., such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) for many different cell types, tissues, and disease states. Moreover, open-sourced computational tools have been developed to enable scientists to mine and draw new insights from existing, publicly available datasets. Before starting a new project (or working on a qualifying exam), it is almost always helpful to dig into some of this data to form rigorous hypotheses. A little bit of time spent mining some of these databases before starting a project can potentially save months or even years of trouble. Some questions you should ask before starting a project include: Where is this molecule expressed? Is it expressed during &gt; health/disease/development? Are there multiple variants of this molecule (e.g., splice variants, &gt; homologs)? Which variant should I study to address my specific &gt; scientific question? What is known about the sequence? Are there certain regions that are &gt; strongly conserved? Does it share sequence homology with other &gt; molecules that can give insights into its function or functional &gt; domains? Is this molecule associated with disease? Are there specific &gt; pathogenic mutations that have been seen in patient populations? &gt; Where do these mutations occur in the sequence? Are these &gt; mutations likely pathogenic or just genetic variation? Is anything known about the structure of the molecule or its &gt; structural domains? If so, can insights be drawn from knowledge of &gt; conservation or the location of pathogenic mutations? Are there &gt; predicted disordered regions that might pose challenges to &gt; conventional structural techniques? What are the known binding partners? Is this molecule part of a &gt; larger macromolecular complex? Do binding partners vary in &gt; different cellular contexts? Is the molecule modified (e.g., PTMs)? Is anything known about these &gt; modifications and what they mean for function? Is it possible to target my molecule with known small molecules? A lot of this information is already available in large public repositories and knowing it can help you to form better hypotheses, design careful and meaningful experiments, and interpret your data. Important disclaimer: There are many tools and repositories out there. My goal is to give a basic workflow that you can apply to your own data. The goal is NOT to give an exhaustive study of these tools and repositories. The goal is NOT to dive into all of the features of some of these databases/tools, rather we will only look at key features. Finally, there are multiple ways to tackle these problems, and my strategy here is definitely not the only way to do things, and it almost certainly isn’t the most efficient way to do things. That being said, the hope is that the approach here will be useful to you as a jumping off point. Some publicly available databases: National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) – National Library of Medicine: This is the well-curated NIH repository. It contains MANY useful resources, including DNA/RNA sequences, protein sequences, structure, taxonomy, lists of mutations, small molecules, and gene expression datasets (GEO). UniProt – Protein sequence, structure, and function Human protein atlas – expression of genes and proteins in different tissues, diseases, cell types, and antibodies. ClinVar – Variants reported by clinicians. This includes pathogenic, benign, and variants of unknown significance. gnomAD – This contains annotated lists of “healthy” human exomes and genomes. Protein Data Bank (PDB) – molecular structures Electron Microscopy Database (EMDB) – Cryo-EM structures MassIVE Database – Mass spectrometry and post-translational modifications ChEMBL – A database with lists of small molecules targeting different molecules. (Selleckchem is a company that also has great lists of inhibitors and activators). Metabolomics Workbench – Repository or metabolomics data. NIH Common Fund's National Metabolomics Data Repository Some useful online computational tools: BLAST – Searches known nucleotide and protein sequences against an unknown. Useful for looking at conservation and related sequences. Clustal Omega – Multiple sequence alignment AlphaFold – Protein structure prediction from sequence AIUPred – Prediction of intrinsically disordered proteins ProtParam – Protein property predictions including isoelectric point, molecular weight, extinction coefficient, hydrophobicity NCBI and UniProt If you are looking for information about a gene or protein, a great starting point is to look it up in NCBI and UniProt. Both databases contain expertly curated information about genes and proteins. Whenever you start a project, this is a great place to begin your studies. Both websites contain information curated in different ways. It should be noted that there is WAY more information on these websites than I will cover in this short introduction, and I encourage you to spend some time with your favorite protein. UniProt assigns a unique identifier to each protein (e.g., MYH7 is P12883). When you look up your protein of interest, you can get information about (with linked publications): Associated biological and cellular processes (Gene Ontology terms) Where and when it is expressed in the body Reported variants and associated diseases Known post-translational modifications and splice variants Known interacting proteins Structures (from the PDB, EMDB, AlphaFold models) Domains and motifs The sequence of the protein NCBI has similar information curated in a slightly different way. It is easy to get sequences from different species from NCBI. In addition to the information in UniProt, there is also information about small molecules that bind to your molecule of interest, links to Pubmed, and information from RNAseq datasets. Genomic sequences are labeled with the prefix NG, RNA/cDNA sequences are labeled NM, and proteins are labeled NP. If you look at the NP file, it is a text file that includes links to the sequence, Pubmed references, information about PTMs, variants, and functional domains. There are also direct links to BLAST, structures, conserved domains, and more! Pro-tip: Record the exact reference sequence identifier that you are using for your studies and report it in your paper. This will prevent confusion between splice variants/related genes. When looking at other publications, it is important to note that they might be using a different reference sequence. It is not uncommon to find the same mutation reported in the literature with different numbering because people are using a different reference sequence. Always double check this before starting your experiments. Also, if you are working with a plasmid, sequence it and double check that it matches the reference sequence you think it should. Conservation across evolution Over the course of evolution, random genetic mutations have contributed to the development of species with different genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes. These random mutations have led to sampling of a vast sequence space. Some genetic mutations are tolerated or harmless, while others impact fitness (both positively and negatively). As such, there are certain sequences that are more highly conserved due to evolutionary pressure, while other stretches are more variable. Looking at sequence conservation can help you to form educated hypotheses about molecules. In general, if there is a strong evolutionary pressure for maintaining a particular residue or sequence, then this sequence will be more highly conserved. Different things can be conserved. For example, in the context of a protein, a sequence can be absolutely conserved. Alternatively, there might be conservative mutations, where the sequence changes but the charge or hydrophobicity is conserved (e.g., changing glutamine to aspartic acid preserves the charge). This is frequently seen with residues involved in forming salt bridges, where maintaining the charge preserves this interaction, but charge reversals or neutralization are damaging. Moreover, within disordered regions, there is often more variation of sequence, but physical properties are conserved (e.g., the charge patterning is conserved). It is also sometimes useful to look at different, but related molecules when forming hypotheses. For example, if there are several related isoforms of a given protein, it is often useful to look at where these differences occur. This analysis can help you to form hypotheses related to what residues are absolutely necessary for function and what residues are responsible for differences between isoforms. For example, some related isoforms may have different binding partners, and these differences could arise from sequence variation and/or insertion of additional domains. Alternatively, small differences at an active site could potentially explain differences in catalytic activity. Finally, it is sometimes useful to broadly look for conservation across different proteins. For example, two different molecules with ATPase activity might show some degree of conservation near the active site, and this can sometimes be used to identify important domains within proteins that haven’t been studied before. It is important to note that it is difficult to assess conservation in closely related species since by definition, they are more genetically similar than distantly related species. For example, there are some sequences that are highly conserved within a certain evolutionary clade, but this sequence may look quite different in a different clade. Thus, when evaluating sequence conservation, it is important to look at multiple, distantly related species. A common approach for looking at conservation is to collect sequences from multiple, divergent species. Both NCBI and UniProt have collections of sequences from different species. Often, it is useful to get several vertebrates (e.g., human, mouse, rat, pig, zebrafish) and some invertebrates (e.g., C. elegans, drosophila). There are multiple formats that can be used for downloaded sequences, but one of the most commonly used ones is FASTA. Multiple sequences can then be aligned in a program such as Clustal Omega, and one can then examine which residues are conserved. It is often helpful to color code the sequences by the type of residue (e.g., aromatic, charged, polar, nonpolar). It is also important to note your reference sequence, since the numbering of amino acids can vary from species to species. If you are trying to identify other proteins that share common features with your protein of interest. One way of doing this is to use BLAST. BLAST allows you to input any sequence and then search for similarities with any other sequence, regardless of whether it is the same protein or not. For example, if I wanted to identify human proteins with similarities to human ventricular cardiac myosin (MYH7), I could use BLAST the MYH7 sequence against other human proteins. In this example, the search will return multiple other myosin isoforms. Alternatively, if you have a protein with a specific domain that you are not sure whether it is found elsewhere in the proteome, you could blast the sequence to see what other proteins share sequence similarity with your protein of interest. Pro tip: One particularly useful feature of BLAST is that you can use it on unknown DNA sequences. For example, suppose that you find a mystery plasmid in the freezer, or a collaborator sends you a plasmid. The first step is to send the plasmid out for sequencing. Once the sequencing is returned, you can use BLAST to check what DNA is in the plasmid. Moreover, if you introduced a mutation into a plasmid, you could run the sequence of the mutated plasmid into BLAST to make sure that you have only mutated your nucleotide of interest. Single nucleotide polymorphisms/variants There is not a single wild-type human genome. Every human is different, and every human genome is different. While there are certainly some variants associated with disease (both monogenic and polygenic risk factors), there are also a lot of variants that are benign (e.g., variants in genes that determine eye color or whether cilantro tastes like soap). The most common genetic changes are single nucleotide variations (SNVs) where one nucleotide is substituted for another. Occasionally, you will see a distinction between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which occur in a sizeable portion of the population and SNVs which occur in less than 1% of the population, but here, we will use these terms interchangeably for simplicity. It is important to note that some SNPs/SNVs are enriched in certain subpopulations, and this information is used by companies to predict ancestry. There are multiple cases in the literature where specific variants have been incorrectly associated with disease because the variant was compared to only a single reference sequence. As such, when looking at variants, it is important to ensure that your database includes populations drawn from all over the world. One place to look at SNPs and SNVs is the gnomAD database. This is an online database that includes exomes and genomes from &gt;750,000 “healthy” people from around the world. You can look at your gene of interest and look at all of the SNVs in your gene, along with the frequency of that SNV in the population. The database includes synonymous mutations (i.e., the nucleotide changes but the protein sequence does not), missense variants (i.e., the nucleotide changes, leading to a change in protein sequence), indels (i.e., a nucleotide is inserted or deleted, changing the protein sequence), and mutations in introns. Importantly, you can also look to see whether a given variant is potentially associated with disease. gnomAD also provides several other useful insights. gnomAD calculates the number of variants that you would expect to see in your gene of interest given normal genetic variation. This is then compared to the number of observed variants. If you observe fewer variants than expected, this typically means that this sequence is constrained, and variants within this sequence are not well tolerated. You can look at the o/e ratio, which is the ratio of observed/expected. A smaller o/e ratio means that the sequence is more constrained. Similarly, you can look at whether the gene is essential by looking at the ratio of loss of function variants (if no loss of function variants are seen, this suggests an essential gene). Another useful metric given by gnomAD is the Z score (genomic constraint metric) such that a more constrained sequence will have a higher Z score. You can also look at the sequence to see whether pathogenic/loss of function variants are enriched in a particular part of the sequence. This information can then be cross-referenced to map these on to specific functional domains of your protein. If you are looking for variants in your molecule of interest potentially associated with disease, there are multiple places to look for information including OMIM and ClinVar. ClinVar is a curated list of variants that have been found in patients. You can search for your molecule of interest and get a list of variants found in the clinic. Variants are classified as benign, likely benign, variants of unknown significance (VUS), likely pathogenic, or pathogenic based on the strength of the clinical data associated with the variant. As a note of caution, it can be difficult to unambiguously determine whether a given variant is causative of disease. Some variants are labeled as likely pathogenic in ClinVar, but then when you look in gnomAD (“healthy” patients), you see that there are a lot of healthy people with that specific variant, suggesting that it might not be a monogenic cause of disease. Moreover, there are some variants labeled as pathogenic in ClinVar based on a single reporter. (There are also papers based on a single patient without additional evidence). As a rule of thumb, a truly pathogenic variant will be rare in the gnomAD database, it will have been found in multiple unrelated family members, and pedigree analysis will show segregation of the variant with the disease. Transcriptomics Gene expression varies from cell to cell, and the exact transcriptome varies with development and disease. Moreover, even within a given cell type, gene expression can vary depending on the physiological state of the cell. For example, fibroblasts can undergo activation to myofibroblasts by TGFB activation or mechanical stretch, leading to major changes in cellular physiology and gene expression. There are large, curated databases of transcriptomic data, including the GEO Database. These databases include bulk RNAseq, single cell sequencing, and single nuclei sequencing. Proteomics and post-translational modifications (PTMs) The proteome varies from cell to cell across development and disease. Moreover, there are changes in the isoforms of proteins that are expressed associated with different cellular states. For example, cancer cells often show dramatic changes in their proteomes. Changes in gene expression are often correlated with changes in protein expression, but this is not always the case. Advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the examination of whole proteomes (i.e., the most abundant proteins, but not necessarily all proteins), albeit with lower sensitivity and depth than RNAseq. There are multiple databases out there consisting of whole proteomes, including UniProt and ProteomeCentral. Many proteins are processed and post-translationally modified. The number of identified PTMs is constantly growing. Moreover, there are a large number of PTMs associated with development, health, and disease. Many PTMs are associated with changes in protein structure and function. For example, phosphorylation can activate and inactivate many proteins. Ubiquitination can mark proteins for degradation. Proteins such as microtubules are heavily modified to interact with different binding partners. There are multiple databases out there consisting of information about PTMs, including the MassIVE database and PhosphoGRID. Care should be taken to focus on PTMs that have been validated in multiple experiments. 1.2 In-class activity In Class Activity 1: Harnessing public repositories and “Omics” Section 1: Basic Information: For this section, we will use the protein calmodulin as a model (CALM1).
